# OAI_Proxy_Checker

Checks the status of all available proxies for GPT-4 keys (you can add or delete them by yourself if you run the Python script itself)

Script is compiled into .exe for easier use. Basically, it runs a check on all listed proxies every 5 minutes and list them in console. If there is a positive change in GPT-4 keys number after new check, program will notify you with a sound.
